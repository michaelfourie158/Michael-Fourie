# My Portfolio Website Documentation
## Hosting

My portfolio website is hosted on GitHub Pages as it is a free resource available for me to do so. This platform provides a simple deployment process by connecting directly to the GitHub repository.

## Innovation
My portfolio showcases innovative aspects through its clean and responsive design, enabling an engaging user experience. The integration of a hamburger menu enhances mobile navigation, allowing users to easily access different sections of the site without overwhelming visual clutter. Additionally, the use of JavaScript for interactivity, such as toggling the menu and handling button actions, adds a layer of functionality that improves user engagement.

## Web Technologies
The website is built using core web technologies, including:

* HTML5: Provides the structure and semantics for the webpage, organizing content into sections such as Profile, About, Skills, Projects, and Contact.
* CSS3: Utilized for styling the website, ensuring it is visually appealing and responsive. Styles are managed using both a main stylesheet (style.css) and a media queries stylesheet (mediaqueries.css) for responsive design.
* JavaScript: Implements dynamic behavior, such as toggling the mobile navigation menu and handling button click events to download a CV or navigate to different sections.

## Compatibility
The portfolio website is designed to be compatible with modern web browsers. The responsive design accommodates a range of screen sizes, from desktops to tablets and mobile devices. Media queries in mediaqueries.css ensure that the layout adapts gracefully to different device widths, enhancing accessibility and usability across devices.

## Navigation
The website features two navigation systems:

* Desktop Navigation: A horizontal navigation bar that appears at the top of the webpage, providing direct links to each section.
* Hamburger Navigation: A collapsible menu that appears on smaller screens, ensuring users can navigate the site without clutter. This menu can be toggled by clicking the hamburger icon, allowing users to explore sections such as About, Experience, Projects, and Contact seamlessly.

Thank you for looking at my Portfolio website. Have a great day.
