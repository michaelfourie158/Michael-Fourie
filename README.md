**Portfolio Website Documentation**
**Hosting**
The portfolio website can be hosted on various platforms that support static websites, such as GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel. These platforms provide simple deployment processes by connecting directly to a GitHub repository or by uploading files through a user-friendly interface. For local testing, the website can be viewed in any modern web browser by opening the index.html file directly from the file system.

**Innovation**
This portfolio showcases innovative aspects through its clean and responsive design, enabling an engaging user experience. The integration of a hamburger menu enhances mobile navigation, allowing users to easily access different sections of the site without overwhelming visual clutter. Additionally, the use of JavaScript for interactivity, such as toggling the menu and handling button actions, adds a layer of functionality that improves user engagement.

**Web Technologies**
The website is built using core web technologies, including:

HTML5: Provides the structure and semantics for the webpage, organizing content into sections such as Profile, About, Experience, Projects, and Contact.
CSS3: Utilized for styling the website, ensuring it is visually appealing and responsive. Styles are managed using both a main stylesheet (style.css) and a media queries stylesheet (mediaqueries.css) for responsive design.
JavaScript: Implements dynamic behavior, such as toggling the mobile navigation menu and handling button click events to download a CV or navigate to different sections.

**Compatibility**
The portfolio website is designed to be compatible with modern web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. The responsive design accommodates a range of screen sizes, from desktops to tablets and mobile devices. Media queries in mediaqueries.css ensure that the layout adapts gracefully to different viewport widths, enhancing accessibility and usability across devices.

**Navigation**
The website features two navigation systems:

Desktop Navigation: A horizontal navigation bar that appears at the top of the webpage, providing direct links to each section.
Hamburger Navigation: A collapsible menu that appears on smaller screens, ensuring users can navigate the site without clutter. This menu can be toggled by clicking the hamburger icon, allowing users to explore sections such as About, Experience, Projects, and Contact seamlessly.
